### Fraud-Detection-in-Credit-Card-Transaction
#### Programming language: Python
#### Project Goal
The problem of credit card transaction fraud is very serious in America. According to ACI Worldwide, 47% of Americans have fallen victim to credit card fraud in the past five years. The Nilson Report estimates that losses from credit card fraud exceeded $27 billion in 2018. Therefore, the bank needs to spend a lot of energy and money to detect this kind of fraud. The purpose of this project is to build a robust supervised fraud model that could properly detect potential credit card transaction fraud.
